		<h1 class="center">Games I play</h1>
		<p class="center">Some of the games are Valorant, League of Legends, Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. Valorant is a first person shooter game in which players typically play in teams of five against another team of five. The game is basically a capture the point game and the first to win 13 rounds, wins overall. League of legends is another team game in which five players are against another five players. They fight until they reach the base of the other team. First to destroy their main point in base, wins. Genshin Impact is a roleplaying game which involves exploring and boss battling. Honkai Star Rail is almost the same except that it is turn based. I mainly play Honkai Star Rail nowadays, logging in everyday to upgrade my characters. </p>
